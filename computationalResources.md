_compute_  is the name of a machine (a computer) which is accessible to all CUSP students. 
You can see all the CUSP computational resources [here](https://datahub.cusp.nyu.edu/computing.html#computing_resources).

If you scroll down you will see the specifications for _compute_. The full path is _compute.cusp.nyu.edu_.

Instructions to access compute are [here](https://datahub.cusp.nyu.edu/computing.html#computing_resources)

The easiest way is to access it with _ssh_, if you have a machine with a terminal (e.g. if your laptop is a mac) by typing

    ```
    ssh -X -A -t cuspid@gw.cusp.nyu.edu ssh -A -X compute
    ```
    
using your cuspid, or by accessing the green environment with your remote desktop and using the compute shell there:

Similar instructions are also in the [slides](https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks/tree/master/slide) (slide 38 and 39), and you can contact the [DataFacilty](https://datahub.cusp.nyu.edu/services.html) with access issues.
