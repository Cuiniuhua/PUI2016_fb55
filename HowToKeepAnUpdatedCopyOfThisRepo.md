This repo includes homework sets and solutions for [PUI2016](http://cosmo.nyu.edu/PUI2016), and lab notebooks.

If you are a PUI student you want to make a copy of this repository, and you definitely want to check for updates regularly.

If you just want your own copy of the repository on your machine what you want to do it __clone__ the repository on your machine as
```
git clone https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks.git
```
That way if I make changes you can update them locally on your machine with 
```
git pull
```
but you will not be able to make changes to my repository (as it should be).

Otherwise, if you want the repository displayed on your browser, you can __fork__ the repository and have your own copy. 
In which case you want to keep it synchronized following these instructions to 
[configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and
[syncing-a-fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
 
 _If you have a fork, you can make changes and request me to embrace the changes with a __pull request__. 
 If you see a mistake (there are many of course) and you want to propose a change you can submit a pull request, 
 but be very clear about the change and it motivation in the description of your pull request, 
 otherwise I will likely dismiss it as something you did accidentally._
