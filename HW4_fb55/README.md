# PUI2016 HW 3.

## ASSIGNED READING:

[Estimating the Reproducibility of Social Sciences](www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full.pdf) Open Science Collaboration, 2015

This is a seminal paper that initiated a number of efforts to increase reproducibility and support open science (e.g. the [COS](https://centerforopenscience.org/))

How to read a scientific paper: you do not need to read all of it (generally scientists don't unless the paper is directly connected with their research.)
On a journal like science the front page of the articleis a synapsis of it. Read that (mandatory). Then go to the body of the article and read:
Abstract (mandatory), Introduction (you can skip it if you think the front page gave you sufficient understanding), 
Tables and Tables caption (mandatory), Figures and Figure captions (mandatory), Conclusions (mandatory). 
_You are responsible for reading **and understanding** the content of the reading material_. If anything is not clear, because of language difficulties or any other reason, please ask!

##ASSIGNMENTS:

Submission Info:

For Assignment 1: work alone. 

For Assignment 2: work in groups of 2. Strictly no more than 3!

For the rest of the HW you can work in groups, and you are encouraged to. 
Create a HW4_<netID> directory in your PUI2016_<netID> repository. 
Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), 
and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to. 

Submit __Assignment 1__ as a pull request markdown file to be added to your classmate repository (see below), 

Submit __Assignment 2__ by including your 2 tables (see below) in the README for the directory 
and Assignment 3 by pushing the notebooks into your PUI2016_<netID>/HW4_<netID> repository. 
Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, 
and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work 

(there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.
